# ðŸ§  COVID-19 Case Prediction using Deep Learning

This project explores the use of deep learning techniquesâ€”specifically **LSTM** and **RNN** modelsâ€”for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 cases. The goal is to evaluate whether these models can not only forecast case numbers but also simulate the impact of public health policies on the progression of the pandemic.

In the notebooks folder, there are all the jupyter notebooks used to run the experiments experiments for this project. The names of the notebooks are self explainatory, the most important ones are:
> run_normal_Experiment.ipynb: Which can be run to predict cases for any of the countries in the dataset.
> run_autoregressive_simulations.ipynb: Used to get and test models using autoregression
> seq_2seq_implementation.ipynb: For the seq2seq implementation.

All experiments were done in these notebooks, either changing the architecture of the model or the input datasets.
